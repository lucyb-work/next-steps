- learn file handling
- create a GUI in the later stages
- make it a wellness thing? 
    - like this: https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/946312252/designer-wellness-journal-a5-wirobound?frs=1&bes=1

What can we start with?
- basic file management - create new file, save it locally
- then, make a user and password for different accounts
- integrate making a GUI with the idea of a wellness journal 
    - maybe have a 'simple mode'? Where people write thoughts like a good ol' diary?
- take inspiration from many different wellness journal formats :)

How confident do we feel?
- solid 6/10, looks challenging but comfortable to begin with
- slightly cyber related
- really want to work on GUI skills especially within Linux :)
